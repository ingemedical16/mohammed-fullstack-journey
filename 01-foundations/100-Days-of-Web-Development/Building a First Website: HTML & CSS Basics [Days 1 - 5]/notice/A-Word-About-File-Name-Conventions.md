# A Word About File Name Conventions

In (web) development, we have a lot of **rules and conventions** when it comes to naming things.

For example, we named our main HTML file ```index.html```. This is NOT something you have to do - it's just a common convention. And some hosting providers might require that name, in order to serve your files successfully. But in general, you could've named it ```My First File.html``` as well. Nonetheless, it is recommended to stick to such common conventions.

The question is: **How do you name your second, third etc. HTML files? And how you should you name your CSS files?**

For **HTML files**, it's generally a good idea to give them names that **describe the main purpose** or content of the page that will be loaded.

For example, if you have a HTML file that will display the shopping cart content of a user, ```cart.html``` might be a fitting name. The HTML file that is responsible for displaying a bunch of online shop products might be named ```products.html```.

For **CSS files**, you typically either have a file that belong to a specific HTML file or you have global CSS files (that are used in multiple / all HTML files):

  - For page-specific CSS files, it's a good idea to repeat the HTML filename (e.g. ```cart.css``` holds the styles for ```cart.html```).

  - For CSS files that belong to multiple HTML files, you might want to choose general names like ```base.css``` or describe the general purpose of the HTML files to which the CSS file belongs, like ```online-shop.css``` for both the ```cart.html``` and ```products.html``` files.

There's also one **important characteristic** which you maybe noticed about all these filenames: They are **all lowercase.**

And that's important! Whilst it's technically not required, it is a **very common convention** that you name your files **all-lowercase**, with **no special characters** except for dashes (```-```). If your file name consists of multiple words, you should NOT separate them with blanks (whitespace) but instead use dashes. So use ```online-shop.html``` instead of ```Online Shop.html```.
