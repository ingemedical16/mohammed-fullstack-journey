# Understanding How HTML & CSS Handle Text & Whitespace

In this lecture, we'll explore two main concepts.

 -  How browsers handle "whitespace" (line breaks and indentation)

 -  How you can output special characters (e.g. "<") as text in HTML documents

## How Browsers Handle Whitespace
In both HTML and CSS (and later also in "JavaScript"), as a developer, you typically try to format and structure code such that it is readable (for humans).

For example, the following two snippets contain the same code and hence would lead to the same result. The browser would understand both, but they are not equally readable / understandable for us humans:

1-  No formatting 
```Html
<html><head><title>A test </title><style>h1{color:red}</style></head><body><h1>Hi there!</h1><p>This is some text...</p></body></html>

```

2-  Formatting with line breaks and indentation (i.e. lots of "whitespace")

```Html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A test </title>
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>This is some text...</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

By default, the browser (typically - there are few exceptions, which we'll explore later) ignores line breaks and indentation in your HTML and CSS code. That's why, as a visitor of the site, you will see the same result for both snippets.

Since the result is the same, but we as a developer are a human, we typically go for the second approach - using lots of indentation and line breaks to structure and organize our code.

## How To Output Special Characters In HTML

When writing HTML code, characters like "__<__" and "__>__" obviously have a special meaning: They mark the beginning and ending of HTML tags.

But what if you would want to output the "__<__" and "__>__" characters or a complete HTML tag as text on your website? Like on this site here (yes, the site on which you currently are). You can read the code snippets above just fine - because they are output as plain text (they are NOT interpreted as HTML by the browser that loaded this page).

There are two main ways of achieving this:

 - You can use the special 
 ``` <pre>...</pre> ```tags (for "preformatted text") - these tags wrap any text (that may include HTML code) and "tell the browser" to output it as plain text (i.e. NOT interpret it as HTML code). When using ``` <pre>```, whitespace is also preserved and NOT ignored (as it normally would be)

 - Alternatively, if you simply want to output the ```"<" ```character (e.g. in some math formula that should be shown on your page), you can use some special "shortcuts" (so-called "HTML entities") in your HTML code:

    - E.g. if you write ```&gt;``` in your HTML code, the browser will output the ">" (greater than) symbol

    - ```&lt;``` => "<" (lower than)
