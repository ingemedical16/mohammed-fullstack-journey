# ðŸ“˜ The CSS Box Model

The **CSS Box Model** is a fundamental concept in web design.  
It explains **how every element on a webpage is displayed as a rectangular box**, and how properties like **padding, borders, and margins** affect layout.

## ðŸ“¦ 1. Structure of the Box Model

Each elementâ€™s box has **four layers**:

1. **Content** â€“ The actual text, image, or other media inside the element.  
2. **Padding** â€“ Space between the content and the border.  
3. **Border** â€“ The edge surrounding the padding.  
4. **Margin** â€“ Space outside the border, separating this element from others.
