# 📘 Understanding Lists in HTML

Lists are one of the most common ways to display grouped information on a webpage.  
They help organize content clearly and make it easier for users to read.

## 🧾 1. What Are Lists?

HTML provides three main types of lists:

1. **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)** — items are numbered.
2. **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)** — items are bulleted.
3. **Description Lists (`<dl>`)** — used for terms and their definitions.

## 🔢 2. Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)

An **ordered list** is used when the sequence of items matters — for example, step-by-step instructions.

### Example:

```html
<h2>Steps to Start Live Server</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Open Visual Studio Code.</li>
  <li>Open your project folder.</li>
  <li>Right-click on <strong>index.html</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select <em>“Open with Live Server”</em>.</li>
</ol>
